    <!-- First section: Tahiti -->
    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><i>Tahiti</i></h3>
    <p>My name is Pratyusha Karnati, and I created a webpage for my awesome trip this last summer. It all started with a trip to Tahiti.</p>
    <p>In April 1769, Captain James Cook made his first trip to Tahiti aboard the HMS Endeavor. Captain Cook also visited the Tahitian islands of Moorea, Raiatea, Taha'a, Huahine, Bora Bora, Tupai, and Maupiti, which he named the Society Islands. Interest
        in Tahiti increased as news spread of the famous mutiny aboard the HMS Bounty. The mutiny was led by Lieutenant Fletcher Christian against Captain William Bligh in 1789.</p>
    <p>Today all of the Tahitian islands are better known as being part of French Polynesia. Bora Bora is perhaps the best known of the islands. Bora Bora is known for its crystal clear water and rooms over the water. However, similar accommodations can
        be found on the island of Moorea.</p>

    <!-- Second section: Laos -->
    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><i>Laos</i></h3>
    <p>After I went to Fiji, I visited the tiny and often overlooked country of Laos. As a tourist, what amazes me is the laid-back manner of the people. Everything here is "old-school," which has a certain charm to it. But the physical beauty of some of
        the locations I went to was not to be missed. The Mekong River is an especially beautiful way to tour Laos. Here are some pictures of my journey down the river.</p>

    <!-- Adding exactly 9 non-breaking spaces between Laos pictures -->
    <div class="center">

        <!-- 9 non-breaking spaces -->
        <img src="laos2.pdf" height="152" border="0" alt="Laos2">
    </div>

    <!-- Third section: The Final Leg of the Trip -->
    <h3 style="text-align: center;"><i>The Final Leg of the Trip</i></h3>
    <p>The final stop on my extended vacation was to a secluded island where I could relax and reflect on my adventures. The beauty of this final leg was incomparable, and I cherished every moment spent there.</p>
